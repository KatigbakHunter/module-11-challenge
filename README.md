# module-11-challenge



Overview: For this challenge, I scraped data from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html to collect data from Mars news articles. After collecting and creating a dataframe from the news articles data for analyzation. Both notbook files used in analyzations are located in the main branch with the created dataset from the Mars news articles. Resources I used to help me write code are Instructor Drew's speed runs and recorded class sessions. I also used BeautifulSoup Quick Reference as a reference to write the code and for better understanding navigation techniques. Both part-1 and part-2 of this assignment is listed in the main branch of this repository.
